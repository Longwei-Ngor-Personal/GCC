            District (SOHO) in London. It is surrounded by the five most famous
            areas in London. It is a very popular area in the city center and an
            entertainment destination full of culture and art. Its reputation
            has also been adopted by many cities such as Hong Kong, New York,
            and MÃ¡laga to name their entertainment district.
