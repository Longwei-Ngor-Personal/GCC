          In recent years, Cambodia has adopted more open investment policies.
          In 2019, its GDP growth reached 7.1%, the highest in all of Southeast
          Asia.

        <p className="md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          This has attracted a large number of foreign investors and
          international investment banks, all eager to develop in Cambodia and
          engage in various mergers and acquisitions. GC Trust, being one of the
          very few companies holding a trust license, seized this opportunity to
          act as a bridge between Cambodia and numerous foreign investors. Under
          the supervision of government regulations, it is committed to ensuring
          that clients can invest with peace of mind.
