              Located in the Chrysanthemum District of Phnom Penh, the capital
              of Cambodia, GC CITY â€¢ Hong An is a 34- hectare project ( 3 phases
              in total ) large-scale high-end residential community that GC CITY
              Century Group has focused on developing. GC CITY connects all
              areas of the project with tree-lined avenues, and uses large areas
              of green space and flowing water gardens to create an elegant
              environment where the sky and water blend into one. We also
              combine contemporary design and architectural style to depict
              fashionable and distinguished living spaces, creating a symbolic,
              high-quality and comfortable living experience. It is a rare
              treasure that is unique in the city. Surrounded by quiet and
              serene gardens and waterway design is a major element of NADI. The
              luxury master-planned villa community conceived and created by GC
              CITY combines a signature combination of residential commercial,
              leisure and park facilities.
