                Why do we choose to invest in Southeast Asian countries but not

                In the past, investors put their focus on the market in America,
                Australia, Canada and the UK. However, since 2017, more
                investors with international insights choose Southeast Asian
                market, hoping to do some oversea asset allocation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important reason is that we can be more rational and
                objective to see the advantages and disadvantages of
                Euro-American and Southeast Asia countries. At the time of
                investing at America, Australia and Canada market, we look at
                the country stability, legal system, social system, education
                resource, and resources of natural environment and humanity.
                They do have their own shortcomings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let&apos;s say America for example, the property tax is
                relatively high. Besides, the buying cost, holding cost and
                maintenance cost are very high. The Euro-American market is
                relatively mature and stable. Its growing rate is relatively
                low.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the past two years, the &quot;One-Belt-One-Road&quot; tactic
                of China has created great influence towards Southeast Asia. In
                terms of the economy, its growing rate is relatively high. The
                expected growth rate of property is relatively high. In
                Southeast Asian property market, the overall cost are low. This
                is a very big advantage of having property in Southeast Asia.

              <h4 className="font-medium">1. Country Stability</h4>
              <p>
                Constitutional monarchy, a mix of royalty of middle ages and
                government with system of capitalism and democracy. One of the
                characteristics is it is relatively stable. Cambodia is a
                politically stable country in Southeast Asia. From 80s to now,
                the stable politics keep the economy of Cambodia in a constant
                growth state.
              </p>

              <h4 className="font-medium mt-2">2. Friend with China</h4>
              <p>
                Among Southeast Asian countries, Cambodia remains a friendly
                relationship with China. This kind of friendship is kept not
                only in the political and economical way. Mostly, it is also in
                the community. The friendly relationship with China is already
                reached to the recognition of culture. This friendly
                relationship is very stable.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Economic Growth:</h3>

              <h4 className="font-medium">1. High GDP growth</h4>
              <p>
                GDP growth is at 7% during normal year. Other than China and
                India, it is rare to have a third country like Cambodia. In
                terms of economic growth, it has a satisfying and stunning
                result.
              </p>

              <h4 className="font-medium mt-2">2. Demographic Dividend</h4>
              <p>
                The demographic structure of Cambodia is extremely youthful. The
                average age of the citizen is 27.5. 70% of the population is 34
                averagely. The demographic structure of Cambodia provides a
                strong support of powerful manpower to the economic growth. It
                also contributes the powerful growth of domestic demand in the
                country. The purchasing power of the youth is the strongest.
                Because of the long term influence from the French colony, the
                citizens strike for living quality is relatively high. Because
                of the fact that the population growth rate of Cambodia is
                highest among Southeast Asia, population will grow rapidly in
                the coming 10 to 20 years. The demand of living is significant.
                This is also one of the reasons why the property market in
                Cambodia is brightening in the future.
              </p>

              <h4 className="font-medium mt-2">
                3. The &quot;One Belt One Road&quot; Strategy
              </h4>
              <p>
                The &quot;One Belt One Road&quot; policy has already changed the
                living in Cambodia. Chinese invested most of the local
                infrastructure facilities. Investment projects include electric
                grid, optical submarine cable, highways etc. It is believed that
                there will be a strengthened investment trend and exponential
                growth.
              </p>

              <h4 className="font-medium mt-2">4. US dollar assets</h4>
              <p>
                English and US dollar are widely used in Cambodia. Most of the
                assets here are valued and traded in US dollar. US dollar is
                used in both bank savings and loan. Using US dollar in the
                currency market can make the assets of the investors remain at a
                stable situation. This is one of the greatest advantage for
                Cambodia compare with other country in South-East Asia.
